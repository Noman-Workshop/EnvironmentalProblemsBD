# Overview of Bangladesh Environment Conservation Rules, 1997
 
An act is a law or the statute which has been passed by the legislature and approved by the President or the highest authority of a nation. However, most laws are not complete code in themselves, i.e. certain provisions as to their application or enforcement etc are deliberately left out by the legislature. That is where rules come into picture. Rules help govern the law. They are secondary. They are in place to make the Act work effectively.

Back in 1995, The Government of Bangladesh enacted upon a set of laws known as Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act (BECA) in order to help conserve our nation's environment. Later on to govern those laws Bangladesh Environment Conservation Rules (BECR), 1997 was adopted.

The Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995 had three major objectives. Conservation of environment, improvement of environmental standards and the control and mitigation of environmental pollution. The Act was formulated on the basis of the policy framework provided by the Environment Policy of 1992 and the National Environment Management Action Plan (NEMAP) of 1995. The act also defines certain environmental offences and prescribes for their punishments.

So, in order to supplement and fulfill the objectives of the Act, the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Rules (BECR), 1997 was approved by the government in accordance with section 20 of the BECA, 1995. The rules consist of four forms and  fourteen schedules. It is also divided upon seventeen different contents. The contents start off with titles and definitions. The rest of the content generally goes to describe procedures, restrictions, notices, validations, fees etc. There is also a declaration for critical ecological sites and information on special incidents. The fourteen schedules that are stated in the rules are mainly on standards about the elements that are relevant to the environment i.e. air, water, various emissions etc. Also the first schedules mention the Classification  of  industrial  units  or  projects  based  on its location and impact on environment and the last two schedules describe fees  for  environmental  clearance  certificate  or renewal and Fees to be realized by the Department of Environment	for	supplying	various	 analytical information  or  data  or  test  results  of  samples  of  water, effluent, air and sound. It is also important to mention the four forms regarding Application for remedy, Notice of intention for collection of sample, Application for Environmental Clearance Certificate, Pollution under Control Certificate.

However nothing is free of loopholes and shortcomings and so is the BECR, 1997. It consists of a number of concerning loopholes and shortcomings.

The third of the four forms from the rules provide an application for environment clearance certificate. The 7th rule and section 12 of the act also speaks about it. But it is unclear what will happen if the Department of Environment (DoE) is unable to meet the timetable to grant the Environment Clearance Certificate (ECC). Section 12 is silent about the standards and parameters upon which the ECC should be obtained.  Section 12 also speaks about the formulation of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report, but it does not prescribe the role of environment experts in preparing the EIA report. However, it provides for EIA reports only of the industrial projects not of the non-industrial projects.

As per Rule 7 of the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Rules (BECR), 1997, the industries belonging to highly polluting Red categories must obtain ‘No Objection Certificate (NOC)’ of the local government authority. But the Conservation Act or Rules does not provide any procedures to be followed by the local government authority in issuing such a ‘No Objection Certificate (NOC)’.

Rule 13 mentions about the determination of the standards for discharge and emission of waste. Regarding management of toxic and hazardous substances, the Rules have broadly defined guidelines for disposal of waste from different categories of industries. But unlike the Environment Protection Rules (EPR) of India, the BECR, 1997 have not specified the permissible extent of emissions or the obligations of corrective actions.

Despite the loopholes the Environment clearance certificate(ECC) has been a good decision all along. The  Rule  7  classifies  industrial  units  and  projects  into  four  categories  depending  on  environmental impact  and  location  for  the  purpose  of  issuance  of  ECC.  These  categories are: Green, Orange  A, Orange B, andRed.All  existing  industrial  units  and  projects  and  proposed  industrial  units  and  projects,  that are considered   to   be   low   polluting   are   categorized   under   "Green"   and   shall   be   granted Environmental Clearance. For proposed industrial units and projects falling in the Orange-A, Orange-B and Red Categories, firstly a site clearance certificate and thereafter an environmental clearance certificate  will be  required.  A  detailed  description  of  these  four  categories  of  industries has  been given in Schedule-1 of ECR'97. Apart from general requirement, for every Red category proposed industrial  unit  or  project,  the  application  must  be  accompanied  with  feasibility  report,  Initial Environmental  Examination  (IEE),  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  based  on  approved ToR  by  DOE,  Environmental  Management  Plan  (EMP).  As  per  ECR’97,  water   resources development projects fall under the ‘Red’ category project. Therefore CEIP-I project is ‘Red’ category project which requires IEE, EIA and EMP for environmental clearance from DOE.The ECR'97 describes the procedures for obtaining Environmental Clearance Certificates (ECC) from the  Department  of  Environment  for  different  types  of  proposed  units  or  projects.  Any  person  or organization  wishing  to  establish  an  industrial  unit  or  project  must  obtain  ECC  from  the  Director General.  The  application  for  such  certificate  must  be  in  the  prescribed  form  together  with  the prescribed  fees laid  down  in  Schedule  13,  through  the  deposit  of  a  Treasury  Challan  in  favor  of  the Director General. The fees for clearance certificates have been revised in 2010. Rule 8 prescribes the duration  of  validity  of  such  certificate  (three  years  for  green  category  and  one  year  for  other categories) and compulsory requirement for renewal of certificate at least 30 days before expiry of its validity. This certificate helps make organizations and personnel sincere in the overall conservation of the environment.
The Rule 3 defines the factors to be considered in declaring an area 'Ecologically critical area' (ECA) as per Section 5 of BECA, 1995. It empowers the Government to declare an area 'ECA', if it is satisfied that the  ecosystem  of  the  area  has  reached  or  is  threatened  to  reach  a  critical  state  or  condition  due  to environmental degradation. The Government is also empowered to specify which of the operations or processes shall not be carried out or shall not be initiated in the ecologically critical area. Under this mandate,  MOEF  has  declared  Sundarban,  Cox's  Bazar -Teknaf  Sea  Shore,  Saint  Martin  Island, Sonadia  Island,  Hakaluki  Haor,  Tanguar  Haor,  Marjat  Baor  and  Gulshan -Baridhara  Lake  as  ECA and  prohibited certain activities in those areas. Beside  these, recently the  government of Bangladesh has  declared  four  rivers  such  as  Buriganga  River,  Turag  River,  Shitalakha  River  and  Balu  River around Dhaka City as ECA. This declaration raises awareness for conserving these critical sites.

However the bad thing about the BECA, 1995 and the BECR, 1997 is that they are back dated. They are not exhaustive and the both are incompatible with the demands of time. It leaves out a couple of important concerns of current time such as radiation and radioactive waste, sound pollution, sight pollution, light pollution, GMOs etc.

In this age of digitalization, radiation from mobile phones or towers may cause a bigger health hazard for citizens.

Noise is a major environmental factor. Noise emitted from vehicles, machineries on highways, roads, footways etc. may grimly affect the environment.

Sight pollution is a common problem in Bangladesh. Sight pollution means any unwanted sight that mentally or physically affects the community or creates any health hazard. For example,  at midday, you are riding a motorcycle to your home hungry for your lunch. While approaching your home, you see an ugly scene of huge mountains of waste on the roadside, including wasted food, used banana leaves, putrefying fruits, etc.After seeing that, can you enjoy your lunch at home? Also, Excessive advertisements, sign boards or billboards etc. in public places are the common forms of sight pollution. In our modern life, especially in cities, the hazards of sight pollution are many.

In our modern life, light pollution has now become a dangerous problem. The inappropriate or excessive use of artificial light is known as light pollution. All the stars in the big cities are already gone. It can also have serious environmental consequences for humans, wildlife, and our climate.

Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) is an important environmental issue. The term “Genetically modified organisms (GMOs)” can be defined as the organisms (i.e. plants, animals or microorganisms) whose genetic characteristics have been altered by the insertion of a modified gene or a gene from another organism using the techniques of genetic engineering. If done wrong it can be hazardous to public health.
Unfortunately, the BECA, 1995 and the BECR, 1997 is totally silent about the things mentioned above. To not have a say in these things portray as bad decisions of the rules.

However these incapabilities can easily be overcome by adopting a few modifications to the rules. A few new rules can be added concerning radiation and radioactive waste, sound pollution, sight pollution, light pollution and GMOs. The loopholes and shortcomings can be demolished by evaluating the policies and standards of the rules, especially the Environment Clearance Certificate. All the ambiguities and lacunas in the both should be removed. People’s participation in environmental decision making should be ensured and protected by law.

Although it is high time for a new set of rules the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Rules, 1997 has been doing so far so good. We can also look forward to a new act as well.
